# Shoe Stores

#### _Epicodus PHP Week 4 Independent Project - MySQL Databases Extended with Many-to-Many Relationships, 3/3/2017_

#### By Maggie Harrington

## Description

An application written in PHP to demonstrate use of MySQL databases with many-to-many relationships and join statements. The application lists local shoe stores and the brands of shoes they sell.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download project at my GitHub repository: https://github.com/php-week4-shoe-stores .
* To clone through GitHub, first make sure that you have PHP, Composer, and MAMP installed.
* See https://secure.php.net/ for details on installing PHP. Note: PHP is typically already installed on Macs.
* See https://getcomposer.org for details on installing Composer.
* See https://mamp.info/ for details on installing MAMP.
* Open the terminal and enter `cd Desktop`. Copy the link above (in the first bullet point), then type `git clone ` and enter the link. You will now have a copy of this project on your desktop.
* In the terminal, type `cd php-week4-shoe-stores/` and hit enter.
* From the terminal, run `composer install --prefer-source --no-interaction`
* Launch MAMP, select _Preferences > Ports_ and make sure _Apache Port_ = 8888 and _MySQL Port_ = 8889.
* Click on the _Web Server_ tab and change the _Document Root_ to the web folder of this project (_Desktop > php-week4-shoe-stores > web_).
* Select _Start Servers_ from the initial MAMP window. If your servers were already running, please restart after making the changes above.
* Open a new terminal window and enter `cd ~`, then start MySQL at the command prompt with `/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql --host=localhost -uroot -proot`
* Use PHPMyAdmin `http://localhost:8888/phpmyadmin/` and `shoes.sql.zip` (located in the root level of the project folder) to import the `shoes` database.
* In your web browser, navigate to `localhost:8888`, which will open the index page.

* If you would like to verify my PHPUnit class tests, use PHPMyAdmin to make a copy of the `shoes` database and name it `shoes_test` database.
* To run PHPUnit tests from the project root, enter `vendor/bin/phpunit tests` into the terminal.
